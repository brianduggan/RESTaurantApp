### User Stories
As a manager of a restaurant, I have 3 types of users, Chefs, Servers, and Admins. Each type of employee has separate abilities available to them. Chefs primarily live in the kitchen and can see the orders that are coming to them.

Servers can see this view as well, but they can also create tables of guests (called parties), and assign orders to them for preparation in the kitchen. Servers can only view and see the parties that are assigned to them.

While focusing on a particular party, a server may add foods, delete foods, type notes, and see the total.

An admin can see all of the functions available to chefs and servers. Additionally they may see all parties in the restaurant and have access to a menu administration mode.
